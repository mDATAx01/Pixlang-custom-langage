#PIXLANG: a custom programing langage

Pixlang is a mini-imperative language that allows for manipulating basic values (integers, reals, and booleans), 
as well as predefined structured types (coordinates, colors, pixels, and lists). It also allows for displaying 
pixels in a graphical window through a primitive language instruction.

It does not have a function call mechanism, nor does it support basic character strings.


Based on Master's level project from the University of Bordeaux, France.
